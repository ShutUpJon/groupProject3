# Welcome to the Roadie App - Find Concert Tickets, Hotels, and Flight in one location!
The idea with this app is to allow you to find Concert Tickets, Hotels, and Flights all in one location for 'Destination Concerts.'

- Want to go see Metallica in New York, but you live in California? No problem.
- Want to see what upcoming events are happening in Denver, CO but you live in Galveston, TX? No problem.

Roadie allows you to search for upcoming events in your hometown, or your home away from home. 
Raodie will also help you trackwhere your favorite bands are touring all across the USA and you can pack up and follow them around like they're the Grateful Dead.

# How it Works:
- Roadie allows you to Search upcoming events via searching for Artits/Bands or Locations.
- Once you've selected an Event, a list of hotels located nearby is generated.
- Once you've selected a hotel to stay at, you can then check for flights.

- Due to API limitations for this project all tickets, hotels, and flights are opened in seprate tabs to allow you to access the ticket site, hotels direct site, and the flight website directly given the parameters you've selected.

# Technologies Used:
MongoDB | Express | React.js | Node.js | Passport.js | React-Bootstrap | Moment.js


# Improvements / What's Next?

- Would like to be able to be able to render API Components directly in app.
- Would like to be able to sort by the Event + Location Search by upcoming dates.

- Would like to be able to save 'Favorites' either Location or Artist/Band for future reference with alerts to let you know when the Band/Artist of choice is back on tour, or in town/nearby. Also, allow alerts for upcoming events based on your saved location choices
