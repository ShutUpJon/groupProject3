# Welcome to the Roadie App - Find Concert Tickets, Hotels, and Flights in one location!
The idea with this app is to allow you to find Concert Tickets, Hotels, and Flights all in one location for 'Destination Concerts.'

- Want to go see Metallica in New York, but you live in California? No problem.
- Want to see what upcoming events are happening in Denver, CO but you live in Galveston, TX? No problem.

Roadie allows you to search for upcoming events in your hometown, or your home away from home. 
Roadie will also help you trackwhere your favorite bands are touring all across the USA and you can pack up and follow them around like they're the Grateful Dead.

 - View the app [here](https://roadie-app.herokuapp.com/) - *Please note that this is deployed using the free heroku servers, and it can take a moment for them to wake up.*

# How it Works:
- Roadie allows you to Search upcoming events via searching for Artits/Bands or Locations.
- Once you've selected an Event, a list of hotels located nearby is generated.
- Once you've selected a hotel to stay at, you can then check for flights.

- Due to API limitations for this project all tickets, hotels, and flights are opened in seprate tabs to allow you to access the ticket site, hotels direct site, and the flight website directly given the parameters you've selected.

# Technologies Used:
MongoDB | Express | React.js | Node.js | Passport.js | React-Bootstrap | Moment.js

API's:
Ticketmaster | Google Places | Skyscanner

# Improvements / What's Next?
- Render API Components directly in app, so no need to visit external sites.
- Sort by the Event + Location Search by upcoming dates. Due to limitations, only Artist/Band Search is ordered by date.
- A 'Save Favorites' Feature. Save by either Location or Artist/Band for future reference with alerts to let you know when the Band/Artist of choice is back on tour, or in town/nearby. Allow alerts for upcoming events based on your saved location choices.
